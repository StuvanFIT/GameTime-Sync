//The prisma client stores the type definitions (i.e. User: id, email, password) in the mode modules
//Note that we do not commit the node modules folder right? So when we go to deploy our application and it runs "build"
//one of the first things before doing a npm run build is to reinstall the type definitions. So in package.json, we do primsa generate
//to install all the type defintions.
